<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh for the spirit which inspired of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seer's prophetic song&mdash;the voice that spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through Israel's warrior king. The strains that burst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In thrilling tones from Zion's heaven-strung harp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Float down the tide of ages, shedding light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On pagan shores and nations far remote:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eternal as the God they celebrate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their fame shall last when Time's long race is run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you refulgent eye of this fair world,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its light and centre,&mdash;into darkness shrinks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eclipsed for ever by the glance of Him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose rising sheds abroad eternal day.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Almighty, uncreated Source of life!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Thee I dedicate my soul and song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In humble adoration bending low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before thy footstool. Thou alone canst stamp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lasting glory on the works of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tuning the shepherd's reed, or monarch's harp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sounds harmonious. Immortality<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exists alone in Thee. The proudest strain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ever fired the poet's soul, or drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Melodious breathings from his gifted lyre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unsanctioned by thy smile, shall die away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the faint sound which the soft summer breeze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wins from the stately lily's silver bells;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A passing murmur, a half-whispered sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard for a moment in the deep repose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Nature's midnight rest&mdash;then hushed for ever!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Parent of genius, bright Enthusiasm!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bold nurse of high resolve and generous thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis to thy soul-awakening power we owe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The preacher's eloquence, the painter's skill,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The poet's lay, the patriot's noble zeal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The warrior's courage, and the sage's lore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! till the soul is quickened by thy breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wit, wisdom, eloquence, and beauty, fail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make a just impression on the heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tide of life creeps lazily along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soiled with the stains of earth, and man debased<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sinks far below the level of the stream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! that thy bright flame should be confined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To passion's maddening vortex; and the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waste all its glorious energies on earth!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world allows its votaries to feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A glowing ardour, an intense delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On every subject but the one that lifts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soul above its sensual, vain pursuits,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And elevates the mind and thoughts to God!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Zeal in a sacred cause alone is deemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An aberration of our mental powers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sons of pleasure cannot bear that light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heavenly birth which penetrates the souls<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of men, who, deeply conscious of their guilt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mourn o'er their lost, degraded state, and seek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through faith in Christ's atonement, to regain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glorious liberty of sons of God!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, as redeemed, account it their chief joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To praise and celebrate the wondrous love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That called them out of darkness into light,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Severed the chain which bound them to the dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unclosed the silent portals of the grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave Hope wings to soar again to heaven!&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Oh, thou bright spirit, of whose power I sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Electric, deathless energy of mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harp of the soul, by genius swept, awake!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inspire my strains, and aid me to portray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The base and joyless vanities which man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Madly prefers to everlasting bliss!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come! let us mount gay Fancy's rapid car,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trace through forest and o'er mountain rude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bounding footsteps of the youthful bard,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Yet new to life&mdash;a stranger to the woes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His harp is doomed to mourn in plaintive tones.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ardent unsophisticated mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On all things beautiful, delighted, dwells.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth is to him a paradise. No cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Floats o'er the golden promise of the morn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hope daily weaves fresh roses for his brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrouding the grim and ghastly phantom, Death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath her soft and rainbow-tinted wings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere Care has tainted with her poisonous breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life's opening buds, all objects wear to him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lovely aspect, and he peoples space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With creatures of his own. The glorious forms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which haunt his solitude, and brightly fill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imagination's airy hall, atone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all the faults and follies of his kind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor marvel that he cannot comprehend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The speculative aims of worldly men:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dearer to him a leaf, or bursting bud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Culled fresh from Nature's treasury, than all<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The golden dreams that cheat the care-worn crowd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His world is all within. He mingles not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their society; he cannot drudge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To win the wealth they toil to realize.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A different spirit animates his breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their eager calculations, hopes, and fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still flit before him, like dim shadows thrown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By April's passing clouds upon the stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment mirrored in its azure depths,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the next sunbeam turns them into light!&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Rashly confiding, still to be deceived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our youthful poet overleaps the bounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of probability. He walks this earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like an enfranchised spirit; and the storms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That darken and convulse a guilty world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come like faint peals of thunder on his ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or hoarser murmurs of the mighty deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which heard in some dark forest's leafy shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But add a solemn grandeur to the scene.&mdash;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The genial tide of thought still swiftly flows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rejoicing onward, ere the icy breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sorrow falls upon the sunny fount,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chains the music of its dancing waves.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is the end of all his lovely dreams&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bright fulfilment of his earthly hopes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too often penury and dire disease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neglect, a broken heart, an early grave!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, had he tuned his harp to truths divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With saints and martyrs sought a heavenly crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How had his theme immortalized his song!&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Behold the man, who to the poet's fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unites the painter's fascinating art;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His touch embodies all that fancy brings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To charm the mental vision, and he dives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the rich and shadowy world of thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soars up to heaven, or plunges down to hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In search of forms to mortal eyes unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To animate the canvass. His bold eye<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Confronts the king of terrors. Through the gates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that dark prison-house of woe and dread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hails the infernal monarch on his throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowned with ambition's diadem of fire.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unsatisfied with all that Nature gives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To charm the wandering heart and roving eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would portray Omnipotence.&mdash;Rash man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reason revolting shudders at the act.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God is a Spirit without form or parts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And canst thou, from a human model, trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The awful grandeur of Creation's King?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature supplies thee with no perfect draught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of human beauty in its sinless state.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man bears upon his brow the curse of guilt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shadow of mortality, that marks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en in the sunny season of his youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The melancholy sentence of decay.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it from such the painter would depict<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vision of Jehovah?&mdash;and from eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dimmed with the tears of passion, woe, and pain,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Seek to portray the dread all-seeing eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which at a momentary glance can read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The inmost secrets of all hearts, and pierce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dark and fathomless abyss of night?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, drop the pencil!&mdash;Angels cannot gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Him who sits upon the jasper throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Robed in the splendour of immortal light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But cast their crowns before him whilst they veil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brow in rapt devotion and adore!&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Nature will furnish subjects far beyond<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grasp of human genius. Didst thou e'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On mossy bank or grassy plot reclined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watch the effect of sunlight on the boughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some tall graceful ash, or maple tree?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each leaf illumin'd by the noon-tide beam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transparent shines.&mdash;Anon a heavy cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Floats for a moment o'er the car of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gloom descends upon the forest bowers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A ray steals forth&mdash;and on the topmost twig<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Falls, like a silver star. From leaf to leaf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glory spreads, shoots down the rugged trunk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gilds each spray, till the whole tree stands forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arrayed in light.&mdash;This is beyond thy art.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All thy enthusiasm, all thy boasted skill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But poorly imitates a forest tree.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">But let us leave the painter. Let us turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To those, who never swept the sounding lyre<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or grasped the pencil,&mdash;ardent minds that hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A deep communion with the winds and waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youthful worshippers at Nature's shrine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What says the soft voice of the plaintive breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mournfully sweeping through the forest boughs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In airy play moved gently by its breath?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To such it hath a language, and it wins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tender echo from the youthful heart.&mdash;<br /></span>

<h4>A FRAGMENT.</h4>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I have dreamed sweet dreams of a summer night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the moon was walking in cloudless light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my soul to the regions of Fancy sprung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the spirits of air their soft anthems sung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strains wafted down from those heavenly spheres<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which may not be warbled in waking ears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More sweet than the voice of waters flowing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the breeze over beds of violets blowing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When it stirs the pines, and sultry day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fans himself cool with their tremulous play.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the sleeper's ear those rich notes stealing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speak of purer and holier feeling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than man in his pilgrimage here below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the bondage of sin, can ever know.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">I heard in my slumbers the ceaseless roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the sparkling waves, as they met the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till lulled by the surge of the moon-lit deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the heaving ocean I sank to sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a magic spell on my spirit was cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forms that had perished in ages past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were by Fancy revealed to my wondering view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the veil of Oblivion she backward drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And showed me a glorious vision, dressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the rosy light of the glowing west.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such colours at parting the day-god throws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gild his path, as rejoicing he goes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a victor red with the spoils of fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To raise through darkness the banner of light!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Slowly and soothingly stole on my ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strains such as spirits in ecstasy hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they tune their harps at the jasper throne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of eternal light, with its rainbow zone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the harmony drawn from those living strings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gushes forth from the fountain whence music springs;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But those songs divine, of heavenly birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are seldom repeated to sons of earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such sounds as I heard by that summer sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were never produced by man's minstrelsy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which rose and sank by the billowy motion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the breaking wave and the heaving ocean:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now borne on the night-breeze was wafted high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the glowing depths of the star-lit sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now mournfully wailing, like plaintive dirge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rushed to the shore, with the rush of the surge.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And I saw a figure, all radiantly bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Float over the waves in the pale moonlight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She moved to the notes of a magical song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the billows scarce murmured that bore her along;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winds became mute&mdash;and the snowy wreath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That crested the billows, looked dim beneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her silvery feet&mdash;that as lightly trod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heaving deep, as the emerald sod.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A garland of coral her temples bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her glittering robes floated lightly round,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Veiling her form in a shadowy shroud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the mist that hangs on the morning cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere the sun dispels, with his rising beam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vapours exhaled from the marshy stream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breeze wafted back from her forehead fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her long flowing tresses of shining hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which cast on her features a lambent glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a halo encircling her brow of snow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revealing a face of such faultless mould<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As that sea-born goddess possessed of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The morning she rose from the purple tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The queen of beauty and joy's fair bride&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But her cheek was as pale as the ocean spray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere it catches a flush from the rosy day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the shade of a deathless grief was there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which spake more of ages than years of care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though she had borne, since the world began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every sorrow and trial that waits upon man.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Such was the shadow that haunted my dream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such was the figure that rose from the stream;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And I felt a strange and electric thrill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of unearthly delight my bosom fill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she neared the shore, and I heard the strain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That charmed into silence the listening main.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Far, far below in the pathless sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where never a sound from the upper air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is heard in those realms where, in darkness hurled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lie the shattered domes of the ancient world!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A thousand ages have slowly rolled<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That buried beneath the waters cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Only echo the mermaids' plaintive song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they weep o'er the form of some child of clay,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The advancing billow from its rugged base;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet many a goodly rood of land lies deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the wild wave buried, which rolls on<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And swallowed up in that unmeasured void,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The hurricanes of years have vainly burst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mar its beauty;&mdash;there sublime it stands,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The shadowy splendour of an autumn sky<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No&mdash;'twas a sound of bitter agony<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrung from the depths of some o'erburdened heart,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A sad inheritance of sighs and tears.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And hair enwreathed with sprigs of ash and yew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bespoke a mind in ruins. On her brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despair had stamped his iron seal; her cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was pale as moonlight on the misty wave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hollow eyes were fixed on vacancy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or wildly sent their hurried glances round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With quick impatient gesture, as in quest<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>

<span class="i0">But shut for ever from her longing view.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The sun went down. She slowly left her seat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cast one long sad look upon the wave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then poured the anguish of her breaking heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a low plaintive strain of melody,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That rose and died away upon the breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mournful requiem of her perished hopes:&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Hark! the restless spirits of ocean sigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can hear them speak as the wind sweeps by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See, the ivy has heard their mystic call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shivering clings to the broken wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dark green leaves take a sadder shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the flowers turn pale and begin to fade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The landscape grows dim in the deepening gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dead awake in the silent tomb.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I have watched the return of my true-love's bark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the sun's uprising till midnight dark;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have watched and wept through the weary day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his ship on the deep is far away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have gazed for hours on the whitening track<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the pathless waters, and called him back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But my voice returned on the moaning blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the vessel I sought still glided past.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We parted on just such a lovely night:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the stars above us their vigils kept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the surges whispered a lullaby,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As low and as sweet as a lover's sigh&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He would soon return to his native land.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">A dark dark shade on my bosom lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nights of sorrow have dimmed these eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The roses have fled from my pallid cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the grief that I feel no words can speak;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He will come!&mdash;he will come!&mdash;I know it now;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waves are dancing before his prow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He comes to speak peace to my aching heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tell me we never again shall part;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can hear his voice in the freshening breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As his bark glides o'er the rippling seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my heart will break forth into laughter and song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I lead him back through the gazing throng.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, no&mdash;where yon shade on the water lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slow-rising moon deceives my eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tide of sorrow within my breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolls on like the billows that never rest;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I will look no more on the heaving deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But return to my lowly bed and weep:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He will come to my dreams in the darksome night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his bark will be here with the dawn of light!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When the song ceased, she turned her heavy eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With such a piteous glance upon my face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It pierced my heart, and fast the gathering tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blinded my sight. Alas! poor maniac;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thee no hope shall dawn&mdash;no tender thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wake in thy blighted heart a thrill of joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The immortal mind is levelled with the dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere the tenacious cords of life give way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hers was a common tale&mdash;she early owned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ardent love that youthful spirits feel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave her soul in blind idolatry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To one dear object; and his ship was lost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sight of port&mdash;lost on the very morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That should have smiled upon their bridal rite.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
<span class="i0">She saw the dreadful accident like one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who saw it not; and from that fatal hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All memory of it faded from her mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still she watches for the distant sail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him, who never, never can return!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Poor stricken maid! thy best affections,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy hopes, thy wishes centred all in earth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth has repaid thee with a broken heart!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love to thy God had known no rash excess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in his service there is joy and peace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A light, which on thy troubled mind had shed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its holy influence, and those tearful eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had then been raised in gratitude to heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor chased delusive phantoms o'er the deep!<br /></span>
